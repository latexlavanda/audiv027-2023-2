Desarrollo de 2do Proyecto Grupal

Arduino Nano 33 BLE features Bluetooth, Python support, Gesture Sensor, Barometric Pressure Sensor, Temperature and Humitity Sensor, Microphone and IMU.
IMU includes 3D accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, for orientation, motion and vibration detection.
This group discussion revolved around the proposal for developing a motion detection code from which an AI could interpret an specific output depending on the position of the Arduino within a stablished frame.
Another option is to use this same sensors on a code that reads motion proximity to generate a specific output, for instance a sequence of sounds that could reproduce a theme, or variations of a well-known song.
We also talked about a Gesture Motion reading to change the pitch of a sound depending on the sequence of gestures performend.
FreeSound.org has lots of data base for ai that revolve arround sounds.
Random generated sound from the psition of the sensor, changing speed of rythm the faster it goes could also be an interesting experiment.
